Bangladesh Bridge Authority is planning to build tens of bridges in the next 30 
years. As a bridge project significantly increases the traffic count, the air 
quality declines. This model will take into consideration of the increased 
vehicles, their emissions, wind velocity and the resultant concentration of 
pollutants after dispersion in the project area.
